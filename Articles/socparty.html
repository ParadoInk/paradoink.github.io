                        <p>Nearly a year ago, the American Socialist party was nothing more than a rag-tag collection of former left-wing Democrats, Socialist Independents, and other assortments of people from all across the spectrum. We occupied only two Governors offices (Lincoln and Atlantic), three Congressional Seats and one Senate seat. We did not have a single Assembly seat.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, a year later, we have seven seats in the state Assemblies, in many cases beating the traditional parties in membership, such as in Chesapeake, where we gained one more seat than the Bull Moose Party. There, we had gained 2 seats during the most recent state elections -- 2 more than we had last time. We retained the Governorship of the Atlantic, our biggest victory of the night. </p>
                        <p>This is not to say we have not had setbacks. The last Federal elections, the recently created Grand Coalition -- the Democratic Party, the Bull Moose, and the Socialist Party -- was destroyed by the Republican Party machinery. Then Socialist Senator Dewey (AC) was defeated by a Republican despite polling being heavily in favor of him; in Dixie, the up-and-coming Congressman Cold_brew_Coffee barely lost against Senator Dexter. The Republicans held a supermajority in the Senate, and while the House was retained, the Republicans expanded their seatship. But we bounced back, as the results of the last state elections have clearly shown.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the year since its founding, the American Socialist Party has retained its left wing bent. We have become the broad tent that we have always intended to become -- one that is non-sectarian, one that accepts people of all left wing beliefs. Democratic Socialists, Anarcho-Communists, Marxists, Maoists, and many others have been united by the fundamental tenets of our program: one based upon the workers control of the means of production, of democratic control by said workers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The night I heard the announcement of the Socialist Party’s founding, I was but a mere campaign assistant to the Democratic party. I was a Socialist. I had campaign as one during a primary for a spot in Dixie against, ironically enough, future Socialist Party leader Cold_brew_coffee. I turned in my resignation to the party, and became a card carrying member of the Socialists.
                        </p>
                        <p>A year ago, we were looked at as an oddity. Not only by the elites, but by common, everyday people. What was the Socialist Party? What did it stand for? Why vote for them over the Democratic Party, the obvious bearer of left-wing movements for the past eighty years?
                        </p>
                        <p>A year later, those answers are obvious: the Socialist party is a party of Socialists and Communists who believe in building a Socialist society through reformism; we stand for the working class and the rural poor who desire a better life; and the reason to vote for us is because we do not accept the logic of capitalism, but instead believe that the only way to improve people’s lives is by destroying it through peaceful but radical reform.
                        </p>
                        <p>I should stress first and foremost that I mean no ill-will to the Democratic Party. My party has worked closely with the Democrats since the Grand Coalition, and I hope our partnership continues to benefit both of us. But I will not get around the fact that the Democratic Party is a capitalist party, which, while better than the BMP and Republican Party, is still limited by the logic of capitalist exploitation.
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is clear that many people have rejected that logic as well. Our voting share has increased dramatically, in addition to membership in Assemblies. The breaking apart of the Grand Coalition gives us an opportunity to enact true reform without the conservatism of the BMP holding us back. The Presidential election is yet another opportunity, as we could influence the Democratic party to elect a working class candidate based upon left-wing values that could appeal to our voting base.
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is important to remember that we are still a small party. We do not have the numbers of the Big Three, and, in spite of our greatest effort, the major echelons of government -- Executive offices, Congressional leadership, committee leadership, etc. -- are still largely out of our grasp. But we should be proud of what we’ve created. We should also be hopeful for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope to see the Socialist Party live to see another year. And, who knows? Maybe we’ll be the ones in the Oval Office. </p>
